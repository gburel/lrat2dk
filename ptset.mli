(*i $Id$ i*)

(*s Sets of integers implemented as Patricia trees.  The following
    signature is exactly [Set.S with type elt = int], with the same
    specifications. This is a purely functional data-structure. The
    performances are similar to those of the standard library's module
    [Set]. The representation is unique and thus structural comparison
    can be performed on Patricia trees. *)

include Set.S with type elt = int

(*s Warning: [min_elt] and [max_elt] are linear w.r.t. the size of the
    set. In other words, [min_elt t] is barely more efficient than [fold
    min t (choose t)]. *)

(*s Additional functions not appearing in the signature [Set.S] from ocaml
    standard library. *)

(* [intersect u v] determines if sets [u] and [v] have a non-empty
   intersection. *)

val intersect : t -> t -> bool


(*s Big-endian Patricia trees *)

module Big : sig
  include Set.S with type elt = int
  val intersect : t -> t -> bool
end


(*s Big-endian Patricia trees with non-negative elements. Changes:
    - [add] and [singleton] raise [Invalid_arg] if a negative element is given
    - [mem] is slightly faster (the Patricia tree is now a search tree)
    - [min_elt] and [max_elt] are now O(log(N))
    - [elements] returns a list with elements in ascending order
